## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document purpose

This document shows the **Quality Assurance activity** to provide **clarity** on the approach taken, The **produced result** and the **conclusion reached** out of this project.


It also demonstrates our **documentation reviewing** and indicates our **testing procedure**, including:

- ***The testing strategy***
  - It outlines **the goals** of the test plan, describing the **testing field**, the **testing environment**, the **test plan scope** and categorizes the **types of testing** involved. 
- ***The execution strategy***
  - Describe how **tests will be performed**, and the process for any kind of issue or bug encountered during the project period.
- ***The test management***
  - It outlines the procedure for **managing the test logistics** and addressing all events that arise during execution.

### 1.2 Project purpose

The project named "Adopter un candidat" (Adopt a candidate in English) has for purpose of **creating an application that allows users to find a job depending primarily on their soft skills.** The application on the employee side will have a scrolling system like ***Tinder***, meaning it will be a side-scrolling to accept or reject the job offer.

On the company side, the app can also be **used on computers** and will have a completely different design. It will look like a tab where they will see the different "matches" of employees, where they **accept the candidates and can message them,** the new messages will always appear on the top of the tab.

The app has to be made on [***Flutter**](#glossary).

### 1.3 Customer

The project has been commissioned by the company ["We Are Evolution"](https://www.we-are-evolution.com/team) represented by [**Oliver Blonsar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-blonsard/) (the employment brand, communication expert and audio-visual expert) and [**Lilou Jourdannaud**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilou-jourdannaud-6b0a60220/) (The communication manager).

They made a presentation on how they wanted the app, we didn't receive any mandatory design so we had to make it from scratch.
