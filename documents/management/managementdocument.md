## Project charter

The project charter is a documents that outlines the project's purpose, scope, stakeholders and objectives. You could find it [here](/documents/management/projectcharter.md).

## Task schedule

To plan our tasks we use Jira as a planning and prioritisation tool.

## RACI matrix

A RACI matrix is a matrix that define each person's responsibilities. It permites to categorise the level of involvement and decision-making authority at key stages of a project. You can find this matrix on the [project charter](/documents/management/projectcharter.md).

## MoSCoW

The MoSCoW method is a matrix for prioritising project needs and requirements.  

`Must have`: Must have this.
`Should have`: Should have this if at all possible.
`Could have`: Could have this if it does not affect anything else.
`Won't have`: Won't have this time but would like in the future.

## Weekly reports
