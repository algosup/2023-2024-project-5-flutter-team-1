## Project Overview

In a nutshell, *Adopt a Candidate* is a mobile and web application design in order to facilitate connections between candidates and companies through a dedicated application. 

The application is coded in Flutter 3 and comissioned by ["We Are Evolution"](https://www.we-are-evolution.com/team) to collect data from candidates and promote a new way of recruiting.

## Project Scope

The mains features of *Adopt a Candidate* are as follows:
- **Anonymization of candidates and companies**: To avoid discrimination in hiring, candidates and companies are anonymized on the platform. This allows us to focus on candidates' skills and potential, rather than their origin, gender, age, etc.
- **Valuing soft skills**: Instead of focusing solely on diplomas and professional experience, the concept emphasises "soft skills", recognising that every candidate has unique talents and skills to offer.
- **Bringing candidates and companies together**: The 'matching' process enables candidates and companies to get in touch and find the ideal match. Candidates can express their preferences in terms of companies and positions, and companies can search for candidates who match their needs. Matching will take place when there is a 50% overlap in soft skills between the candidate and the company.
- **Using an application** : The entire recruitment process takes place on a dedicated application. This facilitates interaction between candidates and companies, offering features such as messaging, personalised profiles, etc.
- **Data collection**: One of the aims of Adopt a candidate is to collect data in order to sell it.

## RACI Matrix

This is the RACI Matrix, it sets out the roles and responsibilities of those involved in each process and activity. 

It's defined who is :
- **R** is for `responsible`, this is the person in charge of carrying out the task, who does the work.
<br>
- **A** is for `accountable`, this is the person who supervises and reports on the work carried out. He must approve the effort made by the director.
<br>
- **C** is for `consultable`, this is the person who provides advice in their field of expertise on how to accomplish a task, or a deliverable.
<br>
- **I** is for `informed`, this the person who is kept informed of the progress of the project or task, changes and results. These are generally stakeholders who do not contribute directly to the projects, but who need to know about the progress of the major phases and any critical difficulties encountered.
