## Week 1

### W1 - Overall project status summary 
05/13/2024 - 05/17/2024

This week is dedicated to setting up the basis of the project and planning the tasks. Ensure that all team members understand the project scope and objectives. 

### W1 - Timeline status

For the start of this project we are obviously on schedule as we have just begun, but we have to be careful not to let ourselves go as we have deadlines to meet.

## Week 2

### W2 - Overall project status summary 
05/20/2024 - 05/25/2024

This week is dedicated to finalising the functional specification, as our program manager's deadline is this Friday 05/24/2024, and then continuing with the code.   

### W2 - Timeline status

 We have made some progress on the documentation, but as far as the code is concerned, we have preferred to let our software engineer get to grips with the language a bit more, as from the start of the project it was Elone who was in charge of the code. Guillaume, our software engineer, wanted to get to grips with Elone and as he had more gaps in his knowledge, we gave him this week to help him gain some knowledge. So we slowed things down a bit without losing the flow of the project.

### W3 - Next steps

For the next we have to finish our documents because of the deadline for the technical specification and the test plan and be more productive on the code, because we don't have enought project time.
