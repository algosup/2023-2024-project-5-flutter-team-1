![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter%20-%20Black?logo=flutter&logoColor=blue&labelColor=white&color=black)


## Overview

Adopte un candidat is a mobile/web application that brings candidates and companies together.
Candidates are anonymous to avoid any form of discrimination based on gender, origin or other factors.

It's based on a principle of soft skills rather than on CVs, the aim being to position yourself on several soft skills and match up with companies looking for these kinds of criteria.

The application is coded in Flutter 3. The project is commissioned by Company "We Are Evolution", in order to retrieve data from candidates.
