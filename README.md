## Overview

Adopte un candidat is a mobile/web application that brings candidates and companies together.
Candidates are anonymous to avoid any form of discrimination based on gender, origin or other factors.

It's based on a principle of soft skills rather than on CVs, the aim being to position yourself on several soft skills and match up with companies looking for these kinds of criteria.

The project is commissioned by Company "We Are Evolution", in order to retrieve data from candidates.

## Version

The project has been developed using Flutter 3.22.0.

The application is compatible with PC and phone, though the devices are dedicated to specific users:
- Phone for candidates
- PC for companies

You just have to run the app on your device and it will automatically detect which device you're currently using.
